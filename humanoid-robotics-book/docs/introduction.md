# Preface: The Hackathon Challenge

The future of work will be a partnership between people, intelligent agents (AI software), and robots. This shift won't necessarily eliminate jobs but will change what humans do, leading to a massive demand for new skills. We have already written a book on AI agents. Therefore, this book serves as a comprehensive textbook for a course in Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics.

This book was created as part of a hackathon project to demonstrate an AI-driven, specification-first approach to content creation using **Spec-Kit Plus**.

# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI

**Focus and Theme**: AI Systems in the Physical World. Embodied Intelligence.

**Goal**: This course bridges the gap between the digital brain and the physical body. Students will apply their AI knowledge to control Humanoid Robots in simulated and real-world environments.

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This course introduces Physical AI—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. Students learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac.

### Why Physical AI Matters

Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments. This represents a significant transition from AI models confined to digital environments to embodied intelligence that operates in physical space.

### Learning Outcomes

- Understand Physical AI principles and embodied intelligence
- Master ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) for robotic control
- Simulate robots with Gazebo and Unity
- Develop with the NVIDIA Isaac AI robot platform
- Design humanoid robots for natural interactions
- Integrate GPT models for conversational robotics
